## Cortex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Seldomberry/Cortex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Seldomberry/Cortex) [![Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3807/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3807)

The Cortex platform is a development environment designed specifically for fast-paced, technology-heavy environments with rapidly evolving requirements and short delivery timescales. Featuring an information-centric design, code generation, auto-documentation, test framework and package management, the platform gives entrepreneurs a competitive edge in getting that next big thing out of the door.

Currently the platform is in its Alpha stage and is expected to reach v1.0 by the end of 2015. 

### From apification to datafication
API's are the things through which us developers have been accustomed to interface with technology. API's are nice. They provide us with user friendly abstractions of things we like, but don't want to know the insides of. Like, you could be a nice person and I want to talk to you, but I don't need to see your organs. Your face and body language provide me with a very apt abstraction of your inner workings.

Because we like API's so much, we tend to APIfy pretty much everything. We even create API's on top of API's. Good developers have achieved mastery of one or more API's. And that was fine.. for a while.

Nowadays we churn out new API's at incredulous rates. Pretty much anything that bears the prefix "smart" has an API. We cannot possibly master all of them. But we don't want to miss out on using them either.

If only all of these API's would follow a limited set of patterns and paradigms. That would make things a lot more manageable. But what should this pattern be? Can this even be done? We believe it can.

To solve this puzzle, we borrowed a paradigm that is already commonplace in defense and industrial IT systems. It is build upon the premise that information is at the heart of everything, and if we capture the essence of it really well, then that is all we need. The paradigm is called information centricity.
