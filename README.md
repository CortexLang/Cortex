# Corto
Corto is a developer-friendly and super extensible framework for building a virtual version of the real world (or a fake one, we don't mind). In corto you first design what your world looks like, and then populate it with real data. We slapped a single, unified API on top of all that data, so you (aka 'the software engineer') never have to worry about where that data came from!

Because there is likely more data in the world than your computer can process at once, corto has a smart design where it only loads the data you need in memory. You can have petabytes of data at your fingertips, and never spend more than 70Kb in footprint!

If any of these is not green, somebody is not sleeping well.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
A Linux or macOS system with `curl` installed. That's all!

### Installing
Installing the corto development environment is simple. Just run this command to install corto to `/usr/local`:
```
curl https://corto.io/install-dev-src | sh
```

### Code example
To get started quickly, run the following command after installing corto:
```
corto create MyApp
```
In the generated `MyApp` directory you will find a source directory with a file
called `MyApp.c`. In the main routine of this application, enter the following
hello world program:

```c
corto_object home = corto_create(root_o, "MyHome", corto_void_o);
float *temp = corto_create(home, "RoomTemperature", corto_float32_o);
*temp = 71.5;

char *str_value = corto_serialize_value(temp, "text/corto");
printf("object %s of type %s has value %s\n",
    corto_fullpath(NULL, temp),
    corto_fullpath(NULL, corto_typeof(temp)),
    str_value);

free(str_value);
corto_delete(home);
```
You can now build the project by running this command from the project root:
```
bake
```
After the build is finished, you can run the executable in the `bin/<platform>` directory!

### Running the tests
To make sure that corto is running smoothly on your system, it is always a good idea to run the tests. To run them, you need a local copy of the corto runtime repository. Running these commands in sequence will run the corto runtime testsuites:

```
curl https://corto.io/install-dev-src | sh
cd ~/.corto/src/corto
corto test
```
Don't worry if you see some `missing implementation` messages. This just means we have some work ahead of us. What is important is that after the test run, you see a message that says that everything is ok!

If the tests fail, please submit a bug report (check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
