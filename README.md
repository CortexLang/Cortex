The Cortex platform is a development environment designed specifically for fast-paced, technology-heavy environments with rapidly evolving requirements and short delivery timescales. Featuring an information-centric design, code generation, auto-documentation, test framework and package management, the platform gives entrepreneurs a competitive edge in getting that next big thing out of the door.

Currently the platform is in its Alpha stage and is expected to reach v1.0 by the end of 2015.
